## Summary [summary]

Thanks for taking the time to read my documentation.

I started my journey in development as a Music Performance Major in college. I broke into the field through contract hardware support and a short time at a Gateway Consumer Support call center desk. Eventually I learned enough about HTML & CSS to land my first position as a junior frontend developer in the Direct Marketing space, contributing to Pay Per Lead aggregation sites and direct client pamphlet sites.

Eventually I progressed into PHP, MySQL, Gentoo Linux administration, and hosting hardware support. In these early days, ColdFusion, PERL, and classic .asp sites with Access backends were still quite common. I supported my fair share of those as well, but I was always captivated by the PHP and FOSS space.

Now some 12+ years into my career, I still get a rush when figuring out something new. It comes less often these days, but when it does it reminds me what drew me to the field in the first place. Looking at a problem from every angle I can think of, imagining a solution, and banging my head against incomplete documentation till it suddenly works.

When not shipping feature branches, I spend time being used as a jungle gym by my two 8mo old twin boys, refactoring my garden, and fragging out on my gaming PC.
